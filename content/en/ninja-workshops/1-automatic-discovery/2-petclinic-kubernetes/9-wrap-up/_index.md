Congratulations, you have completed the **Get the Most Out of Your Existing Kubernetes Java Applications Using Automatic Discovery and Configuration With OpenTelemetry** workshop.

Today, you have learned how easy it is to add Tracing, Code Profiling and Database Query Performance to your existing Java application in Kubernetes.

You immediately improved the observability of the application and infrastructure without touching a line of code or configuration using **Automatic Discovery and Configuration**.

You also learned that with simple configuration changes, you can add even more observability (**logging** and **RUM**) to the application in order to provide end-to-end observability.
