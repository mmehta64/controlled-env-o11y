As we have seen in the previous section, once you enable **automatic discovery and configuration** on your services, traces are sent to **Splunk Observability Cloud**.

With these traces, Splunk will automatically generate **Service Maps** and **RED Metrics**. These are the first steps in understanding the behavior of your services and how they interact with each other.

In this next section, we are going to examine the traces themselves and the information they provide to help you understand the behavior of your services -- all without touching your code!
