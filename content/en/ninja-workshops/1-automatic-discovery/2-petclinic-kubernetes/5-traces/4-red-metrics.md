Splunk APM provide **Service Centric Views** that provide engineers a deep understanding of service performance in one centralized view. Now, across every service, engineers can quickly identify errors or bottlenecks from a serviceâ€™s underlying infrastructure, pinpoint performance degradations from new deployments, and visualize the health of every third party dependency.

To see this dashboard for the `api-gateway`, click on **APM** from the right hand menu and go to the **Dependency Map**. Make sure you have the `api-gateway` service selected in the Service Map, then click on the ***View Service** button in the top, right-hand pane. This will bring you to the Service Centric View dashboard:

This view, which is available for each of your instrumented services, offers an overview of **Service metrics**, **Runtime metrics** and **Infrastructure metrics**.

You can select the **Back** function of you browser to go back to the previous view.
