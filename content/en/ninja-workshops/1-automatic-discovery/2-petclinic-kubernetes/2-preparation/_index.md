```

To ensure your instance is configured correctly, we need to confirm that the required environment variables for this workshop are set correctly. In your terminal, run the following script and check that the environment variables are present and set with actual valid values:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab title="Script" %}}

``` bash
. ~/workshop/petclinic/scripts/check_env.sh
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab title="Example Output" %}}

``` bash
ACCESS_TOKEN = <redacted>
REALM = <e.g. eu0, us1, us2, jp0, au0 etc.>
RUM_TOKEN = <redacted>
HEC_TOKEN = <redacted>
HEC_URL = https://<...>/services/collector/event
INSTANCE = <instance_name>
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Please make a note of the `INSTANCE` environment variable value as this will be used later to filter data in **Splunk Observability Cloud**.

For this workshop, **all** the above environment variables are required. If any have values missing, please contact your Instructor.
