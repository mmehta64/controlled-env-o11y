Lets start with a quick, high level tour of RUM by clicking **RUM** in the left-hand menu. Then change the **Environment** filter **(1)** to the name of your workshop instance from the dropdown box, selecting **`<INSTANCE>-workshop`** **(1)** (where **`INSTANCE`** is the value from the shell script you ran earlier). Make sure it is the only one selected.

Then change the **App** **(2)** dropdown box to the name of your app, it will be **`<INSTANCE>-store`**

Once you have selected your **Environment** and **App**, you will see an overview page showing the RUM status of your Application. (If your Summary Dashboard is just a single row of numbers, you are looking at the condensed view. You can expand it by clicking on the **> (1)** in front of the Application name). If any JavaScript errors occurred, they will show up as shown below:

To continue, click on the blue link (with your workshop name) to get to the details page. This will bring up a new dashboard view breaking down the interactions by UX Metrics, Front-end Health, Back-end Health and Custom Events and comparing them to historic metrics (1 hour by default).
