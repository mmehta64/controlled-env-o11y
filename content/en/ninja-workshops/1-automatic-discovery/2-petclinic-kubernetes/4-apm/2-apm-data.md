Return to Splunk Observability Cloud, and from the left-hand menu click on  ![APM](../../images/apm-icon.png?classes=inline&height=25px) **APM** to see the data generated by the traces from the newly instrumented services. Change the **Environment** filter **(1)** to the name of your workshop instance in the dropdown box. (Note: this will be **`<INSTANCE>-workshop`** where **`INSTANCE`** is the value from the shell script you ran earlier. Ensure it is the only one selected.)

![apm](../../images/zero-config-first-services-overview.png)

You will see the name **(2)** of the **api-gateway** service and metrics in the Latency and Request & Errors charts. (If you see a Critical Alert, you can ignore it as it is caused by the sudden request increase generated by the load generator). You will also see the rest of the services appear.

Once you see the Customer service, Vets service and Visits services as shown in the screenshot above, click on the **Service Map** **(3)**  pane to get ready for the next section.
