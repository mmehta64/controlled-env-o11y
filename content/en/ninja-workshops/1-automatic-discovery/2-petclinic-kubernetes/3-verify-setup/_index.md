Once the installation has completed, you can log in to **Splunk Observability Cloud** and verify that the metrics are flowing in from your Kubernetes cluster.

From the left-hand menu, click on **Infrastructure** and select **Kubernetes**, then select the **Kubernetes nodes** pane. Once you are in the **Kubernetes nodes** view, change the **Time** filter from **-4h** to the last 15 minutes **(-15m)** to focus on the latest data.

Next, from the list of clusters, select the cluster name of your workshop instance. Note: You can get the unique part from your cluster name by using the `INSTANCE` from the output from the shell script you ran earlier. **(1)**

You will now only have your cluster visible.
Scroll down the page to see the metrics coming in from your cluster. Locate the **Node log events rate** chart and click on a vertical bar to see the log entries coming in from your cluster.
