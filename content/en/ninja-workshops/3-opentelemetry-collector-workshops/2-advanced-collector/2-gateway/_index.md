The OpenTelemetry Gateway is designed to receive, process, and export telemetry data. It acts as an intermediary between telemetry sources (e.g. applications, services) and backends (e.g., observability platforms like Prometheus, Jaeger, or Splunk Observability Cloud).

The gateway is useful because it centralizes telemetry data collection, enabling features like data filtering, transformation, and routing to multiple destinations. It also reduces the load on individual services by offloading telemetry processing and ensures consistent data formats across distributed systems. This makes it easier to manage, scale, and analyze telemetry data in complex environments.

- In the **Gateway terminal** window, change into the `[WORKSHOP]` directory and create a new subdirectory named `2-gateway`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Change _ALL_ terminal windows to the `[WORKSHOP]/2-gateway` directory.**

- Back in the **Gateway terminal** window, copy `agent.yaml` from the `1-agent` directory into `2-gateway`.
- Create a file called `gateway.yaml` and add the following initial configuration:

```yaml { title="gateway.yaml" }

> [!NOTE]
> When the `gateway` is started it will generate three files: `gateway-traces.out`, `gateway-metrics.out`, and `gateway-logs.out`. These files will eventually contain the telemetry data received by the gateway.
