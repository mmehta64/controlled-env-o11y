Welcome to the workshop on **Dashboards and Detectors** in the Splunk Observability Cloud. This session is designed to help you get hands-on experience with building insightful visualizations and setting up proactive monitoring using built-in capabilities.

We’ll be working with existing demo data available in the Splunk Observability Suite. You can follow along using any **trial** or **production** Splunk Observability organization that you have access to.

### What You’ll Learn

### Dashboards

In the first part of the workshop, we’ll focus on dashboards and charts:

* Understanding dashboards and the role of charts
* Editing existing charts and creating new ones
* Applying filters and using analytical functions
* Building and customizing formulas
* Saving charts into a dashboard for reuse
* An introduction to SignalFlow for advanced charting

### Detectors

In the second part, we’ll shift to alerting and monitoring with detectors:

* What detectors are and how they work in Splunk Observability
* Creating simple detectors using thresholds
* Using SignalFlow to create advanced, condition-based alerts
* Managing alert rules and notification policies
* Exploring alert timelines and history
* Best practices for building actionable detectors
