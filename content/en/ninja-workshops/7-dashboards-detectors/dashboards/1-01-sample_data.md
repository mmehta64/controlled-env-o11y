## 1. Exploring the Sample Data

In the list of available dashboards, look for a group called **Sample Data (2)**.

This group contains dashboards that showcase visualizations built from sample metrics. These will give you a sense of how different data can be represented using charts and dashboards in Splunk Observability.

Expand the **Sample Data** dashboard group by clicking on it, then select the **Sample Charts (3)** dashboard.

This dashboard showcases a variety of chart types, styles, and formatting options available in Splunk Observability. Itâ€™s a great way to get a feel for how flexible and customizable your dashboards can be.

The sample data runs on a 10-minute cycle, generating different patterns and behaviors over time.  
To see these changes in action, adjust the time range in the top-right corner of the dashboard to **Last 15 minutes** or, for a better overview, select **Last 1 hour**. This will help you observe how the data updates and cycles through different conditions.

Take a moment to explore the charts in this dashboard, each one provides a different perspective on how sample data can be visualized.
