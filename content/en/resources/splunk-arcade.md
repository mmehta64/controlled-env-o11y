### **Unlock the Power of Telemetry Through Play**  

Imagine stepping into an **80s-inspired arcade**, where every high score, every power-up, and every epic fail isn’t just fun—it’s **real data feeding into Splunk!** Welcome to **Splunk Arcade**, an **interactive, gamified learning experience** that transforms classic arcade action into a **hands-on observability workshop**.  

Here’s the deal: **You play. Splunk observes.** Every move you make in these custom-built HTML games generates **metrics, traces, and logs**—just like your real-world applications. The difference? Instead of debugging a dull enterprise system, you’re **blasting aliens and hunting bugs** in a neon-lit, pixel-perfect throwback to the golden age of gaming.

### **🎮 GAMES THAT TEACH AS YOU PLAY**  

##### **🛸 SPACE IMVADERS – The Observability Invasion**

*(Inspired by Space Invaders)*  
**Mission:** Defend Earth from waves of alien bugs!  
**Observability Lesson:** Every laser blast, every hit, and every lost life generates **real-time telemetry data**—error rates, and request latency. Watch as your **Splunk dashboards light up** with performance insights, showing you exactly how "system health" translates into gameplay.  But the *real* alien bugs are the ones in your own code!  Can you and Splunk save the Earth (and your job!) from destruction?!

##### **🐸 LOGGER – Hop Through the Data Stream**

*(Inspired by Frogger)*  
**Mission:** Navigate a chaotic river of scrolling logs, avoiding errors and latency spikes!  
**Observability Lesson:** As you leap from log to log, Splunk captures **end-to-end traces**, helping you visualize the **user journey**—just like tracking a real application’s flow. Miss a jump? That’s a **failed transaction**. Make it across? That’s a **successful trace**. Help your team of frogs across and see your customers win!

##### **🔫 BUGHUNT – Shoot Down Glitches Before They Crash Your System**

*(Inspired by Duck Hunt)*  
**Mission:** Take aim at flying bugs—but these aren’t just pixels; they’re **real application errors** in disguise!
